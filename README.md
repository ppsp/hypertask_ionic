# HyperTask  
  
**Hybrid Mobile App for Managing Tasks and Habits**   
HyperTask is a productivity app designed to help users manage their tasks and build better habits with an intuitive interface and powerful features.  
This is a project I did for fun and for using myself.

Habit Tracking: Track your habits and stay consistent with your goals.  
Cross-Platform: Built using Ionic Framework and Angular, HyperTask runs on both Android and iOS (iOS untested).  
Backend Powered by ASP.NET Core: Fast and reliable backend built with ASP.NET Core.  
Cloud Hosted on Azure: Deployment script included for fast setup on Azure.  
Authentication: Easy and secure logins with Firebase.
